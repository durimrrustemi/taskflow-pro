    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

```bash
# Create a project first
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Demo Project",
    "description": "Project for interview demo"
  }'

# Create tasks
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \

  -d '{
    "title": "Implement user authentication",
    "description": "Add JWT-based auth system",
    "projectId": "PROJECT_UUID",
    "priority": "high",
    "tags": ["backend", "security"]
  }'

# Show advanced filtering
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/tasks?page=1&limit=5&priority=high&sortBy=createdAt&sortOrder=DESC" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### **4. Redis Caching Demo (2 minutes)**
```bash
# Connect to Redis container
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli

# Show cached data
KEYS *
GET "user:123"
GET "task:456"
```

### **5. Bull Queue Demo (3 minutes)**
- **Open Bull Board**: http://localhost:3001
- **Show**:
  - Active jobs
  - Completed jobs
  - Failed jobs
  - Job statistics

```bash
# Trigger background jobs by creating/updating tasks
# Watch the queue in real-time
```

### **6. Database Schema (2 minutes)**
```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d taskflow_pro

# Show tables
\dt

# Show task data
SELECT id, title, status, priority, created_at FROM tasks LIMIT 5;
```

### **7. Docker & Infrastructure (2 minutes)**
```bash
# Show running containers
docker-compose ps

# Show logs
docker-compose logs app --tail=20

# Show Dockerfile
cat Dockerfile
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Talking Points**

### **Technical Architecture**
- "I built a microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns"
- "Used Docker for containerization and easy deployment"
- "Implemented proper authentication with JWT tokens"
- "Added comprehensive input validation and error handling"

### **Database Design**
- "Designed a normalized database schema with proper relationships"
- "Used UUIDs for better security and scalability"
- "Implemented soft deletes and audit trails"
- "Added database views for analytics"

### **Performance & Scalability**
- "Implemented Redis caching for better performance"
- "Used Bull queues for background job processing"
- "Added pagination to handle large datasets"
- "Implemented proper indexing for database queries"

### **API Design**
- "Followed RESTful principles with proper HTTP methods"
- "Added comprehensive Swagger documentation"
- "Implemented proper error handling and status codes"
- "Added input validation and sanitization"

### **Production Readiness**
- "Added health checks and monitoring"
- "Implemented proper logging and error tracking"
- "Used environment variables for configuration"
- "Added Docker Compose for easy local development"

## ðŸš¨ **Common Interview Questions & Answers**

### **Q: How do you handle authentication?**
**A:** "I implemented JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens. The access token is short-lived for security, while the refresh token allows seamless re-authentication. I also added middleware to protect routes and validate tokens."

### **Q: How do you ensure data consistency?**
**A:** "I use database transactions for critical operations, proper foreign key constraints, and input validation. I also implemented soft deletes to maintain data integrity while allowing recovery."

### **Q: How do you handle high traffic?**
**A:** "I implemented Redis caching for frequently accessed data, pagination to limit response sizes, and background job processing to handle heavy operations asynchronously. The application is also containerized for easy horizontal scaling."

### **Q: How do you ensure code quality?**
**A:** "I added comprehensive input validation with Joi schemas, proper error handling, logging, and testing. I also used TypeScript-style JSDoc comments for better code documentation and IDE support."

## ðŸ“Š **Demo Checklist**

- [ ] Project starts successfully with Docker
- [ ] Swagger UI loads and shows all endpoints
- [ ] Can register and login a user
- [ ] Can create, read, update, and delete tasks
- [ ] Can filter and paginate results
- [ ] Redis is caching data
- [ ] Bull queues are processing jobs
- [ ] Database has proper schema
- [ ] All services are healthy

## ðŸŽ¬ **Pro Tips for Interview**

1. **Start with the big picture** - Show the architecture diagram
2. **Demonstrate live coding** - Make API calls in real-time
3. **Explain your decisions** - Why Redis? Why Bull queues?
4. **Show error handling** - Demonstrate what happens with invalid data
5. **Highlight scalability** - Show how you'd handle more users
6. **Be prepared for questions** - Know your code inside and out

## ðŸ”§ **Backup Plans**

- **If Docker fails**: Show the code structure and explain the setup
- **If API fails**: Show the Swagger documentation and code
- **If internet is slow**: Have screenshots ready of the UI
- **If time is short**: Focus on the most impressive features (Swagger, filtering, queues)
